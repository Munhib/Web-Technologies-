## Project Description
This project recreates the front page of Jang newspaper from January 5, 1986, which covered a major national tragedy where fifty people were killed and thirty injured in five separate incidents across Pakistan. The recreation uses pure HTML with inline styling to match the traditional three-column newspaper layout, preserving the visual hierarchy and structure of the original Urdu newspaper while translating major content into English.

- Three-column table layout for traditional newspaper column structure
- Eight images with descriptive alt attributes for accessibility (logo, victim grid, nexttologo, bottomleft, lowermid, bottommid, bottomright)
- Complete heading hierarchy using h1, h2, h3, and h4 tags appropriately
- Unordered list (ul) in the "News in Brief" section with six news items
- Comprehensive HTML comments explaining the purpose of every major tag and section
- Consistent 4-space indentation throughout the entire document
- Inline CSS styling for layout, typography, borders, colors, and spacing
- Responsive image sizing using max-height and width properties
- Nested table structure in header for logo-title-image layout
- Multiple article tags for independent news stories
- Section tags for thematically grouped content areas

## Challenges Faced
